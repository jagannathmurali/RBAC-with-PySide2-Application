# RBAC-with-PySide2-Application
Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of restricting data access based on the roles of individual users. RBAC gives the users a predefined role with access rights only to the information they need to do their jobs and prevents them from accessing information that doesn't required for them.

The Patient Details and the User details are stored in csv file as of now. It can be converted to SQL later.
